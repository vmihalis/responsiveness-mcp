# Requirements: Screenie v2.2

**Defined:** 2026-01-21
**Core Value:** Instantly verify that a web app looks correct across all device sizes without manual testing - run one command, review one report.

## v2.2 Requirements

Requirements for ASCII Art Branding milestone.

### Branding

- [x] **BRAND-01**: ASCII art banner with "SCREENIE" text in stylish block letters
- [x] **BRAND-02**: Banner includes version number display
- [x] **BRAND-03**: Banner includes brief tagline
- [x] **BRAND-04**: Graceful handling of narrow terminal widths

### CLI Integration

- [x] **CLI-05**: `screenie --version` displays ASCII banner + version
- [x] **CLI-06**: `screenie -v` alias works identically

### Install Experience

- [—] **INST-01**: Postinstall script displays ASCII banner on `npm install -g` — SKIPPED (security anti-pattern)
- [x] **INST-02**: Quick-start hint included in version banner output

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded for v2.2:

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Animated ASCII art | Unnecessary complexity, static is sufficient |
| Color gradients in terminal | Not all terminals support, keep simple |
| ASCII art on every command run | Gets annoying, version/install only |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| BRAND-01 | Phase 19 | Complete |
| BRAND-02 | Phase 19 | Complete |
| BRAND-03 | Phase 19 | Complete |
| CLI-05 | Phase 19 | Complete |
| CLI-06 | Phase 19 | Complete |
| INST-01 | — | Skipped (security anti-pattern) |
| INST-02 | Phase 19 | Complete |
| BRAND-04 | Phase 20 | Complete |

**Coverage:**
- v2.2 requirements: 8 total
- Completed: 7
- Skipped: 1 (INST-01 - security best practice)

---

## Milestone Summary

**Shipped:** 7 of 8 v2.2 requirements

**Adjusted:**
- INST-02 (quick-start hint) delivered via version banner instead of postinstall script

**Dropped:**
- INST-01 (postinstall banner) — intentionally skipped per security best practices. Postinstall scripts are a security anti-pattern in 2026 (pnpm 10+ disables by default).

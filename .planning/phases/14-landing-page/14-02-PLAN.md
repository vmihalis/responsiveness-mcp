  <name>Task 1: Deploy to Netlify via CLI</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Attempt to deploy to Netlify using the CLI:

1. **Check if Netlify CLI is installed:**
   ```bash
   netlify --version || npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. **Deploy landing directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /home/memehalis/responsiveness-mcp
   netlify deploy --dir=landing --prod
   ```

   If this prompts for authentication or fails with auth error, note the error and proceed to checkpoint.

   If deployment succeeds, capture the deployed URL (will be something like *.netlify.app initially).
  </action>
  <verify>
netlify status 2>/dev/null || echo "Need to authenticate or link site"
  </verify>
  <done>
Either:
- Site deployed to *.netlify.app URL, OR
- Authentication required (proceed to checkpoint)
  </done>

## Netlify Setup Required

Claude attempted to deploy via CLI but authentication is needed.

### Step 1: Authenticate Netlify CLI
```bash
netlify login
```
This will open a browser to authenticate. Authorize the CLI.

### Step 2: Link Repository (if not done)
```bash
cd /home/memehalis/responsiveness-mcp
netlify init
```
- Select "Create & configure a new site"
- Choose your team
- Site name: screenie (or accept generated name)

### Step 3: Deploy
```bash
netlify deploy --dir=landing --prod
```

### Step 4: Configure Custom Domain (Netlify Dashboard)
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Select your site
3. Go to Site Settings -> Domain Management
4. Click "Add custom domain"
5. Enter: screenie.xyz
6. Follow DNS configuration instructions

### DNS Configuration Options

**Option A: Netlify DNS (Recommended)**
- Select "Set up Netlify DNS" in the dashboard
- Update your domain registrar's nameservers to Netlify's (shown in UI)
- Netlify handles everything automatically

**Option B: External DNS**
- Add A record: screenie.xyz -> 75.2.60.5
- Add CNAME record: www.screenie.xyz -> your-site-name.netlify.app

Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours, usually 5-30 minutes).

### Step 5: Verify SSL
Netlify auto-provisions SSL. Check Site Settings -> Domain Management for certificate status.

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 3: Verify deployment and performance</name>
  <what-built>Complete landing page deployed to screenie.xyz</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. **Visit https://screenie.xyz**
   - Page should load instantly (under 1 second)
   - Dark background (Catppuccin Mocha theme #1e1e2e)
   - "screenie" heading in mauve/purple color
   - Demo GIF playing automatically above the fold
   - Install command visible with Copy button

2. **Test copy functionality**
   - Click the Copy button
   - Button text should change to "Copied!"
   - Paste somewhere to verify "npx screenie https://your-site.com" was copied

3. **Test links**
   - GitHub link opens https://github.com/memehalis/screenie
   - npm link opens https://www.npmjs.com/package/screenie

4. **Run Lighthouse (recommended)**
   - Open Chrome DevTools (F12) -> Lighthouse tab
   - Run Performance audit on Mobile
   - Target: 95+ performance score
   - If under 95, note the issues

5. **Check HTTPS**
   - Padlock icon should appear in browser address bar
   - Certificate should be valid (click padlock to verify)
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if all checks pass, or describe issues found</resume-signal>

After deployment approved:

1. **Site accessible:**
   ```bash
   curl -I https://screenie.xyz
   # Should return 200 OK with HTTPS
   ```

2. **Content correct:**
   ```bash
   curl -s https://screenie.xyz | grep -c "screenie"
   # Should be >= 3 (title, h1, various mentions)
   ```

3. **Security headers:**
   ```bash
   curl -I https://screenie.xyz 2>/dev/null | grep -i "x-frame-options"
   # Should show DENY
   ```

4. **Cache headers on assets:**
   ```bash
   curl -I https://screenie.xyz/demo.gif 2>/dev/null | grep -i "cache-control"
   # Should show max-age=31536000
   ```
